# 🚦 Smart City Transportation Network Optimization

This project is part of the **CSE112 – Design and Analysis of Algorithms** course at Alamein International University. It provides a comprehensive solution to optimize urban transportation in the Greater Cairo area using advanced algorithmic techniques.

---

## 📌 Objective

Design a transportation management system that:
- Models Cairo’s road and transit network as a weighted graph
- Optimizes road construction, public transit, and emergency routing
- Uses real-world constraints like traffic patterns and facility accessibility

---

## 📊 Features

### ✅ Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- Kruskal’s/Prim’s algorithm to design cost-efficient road networks
- Modified for population density and facility access

### 🚗 Shortest Path & Traffic Flow
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm for basic route planning
- A* Search for emergency vehicle routing
- Time-dependent shortest path algorithms for rush hour simulation

### 🚑 Emergency Response Optimization
- Priority-based routing for ambulances/fire vehicles
- Intersection preemption and delay minimization

### 🚌 Public Transit Scheduling
- Dynamic Programming to optimize bus/metro scheduling
- Resource allocation for maintenance and high-demand routes

### 🚦 Greedy Traffic Signal Control
- Real-time signal scheduling for traffic flow efficiency
